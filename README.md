# METACRAFTERS
In this undertaking, we have utilized fundamental operations and variables that have been taught throughout the different units using solidity. The main objective of this endeavor is to make your symbol on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, learn essential operations, such as generating and consuming the tokens, and also writing conditional statements to reduce essential errors.

Executing program

To execute this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To begin, go to the Remix site at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix site, make another record by clicking on the plus symbol in the left-hand sidebar. Save the record with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). After writing the code according to the instructions, we can test the code using the left tab labeled "deploy". You can generate a few coins and check the total supply and balances.

My Experience

I truly had a good time coding using solidity, this concept was very unfamiliar to me, I think I understood the concept and language very well. I am looking forward to completing more units and courses in MetaCrafters.
